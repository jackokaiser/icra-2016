To mention in e-mail:
* IEEE to journal shows affiliation and email (is mine all right?)
* not removing "of around 3s" -> it gives the reader an idea of what is short to us (in some paper its 2minutes)
* Theoritical Singularities  -> pointing to Ago's paper
* Yaw is not observable
* removed setup sketch - it is now well explained in text, plus the features are not virtual
* set to 2.8 seconds
